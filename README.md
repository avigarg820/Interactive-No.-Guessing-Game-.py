# Interactive Number-Guessing Game
This is a small project in the form of a game that I made in Python, Anyone looking to engage in an interactive game of guessing, and give themselves a boost should attend. 

FEATURES: 

1).A motivational message that sets a realistic goal for the player. 
2).A number between 1 and 100 will be chosen at random. 
3).There is a guiding system to arrive at the right answer in addition to the user's guesses.
4).When the game is over, the number of guesses made will be tallied, and based on that information, more data will be provided.
## Deployment

To deploy this project:
1). You must have latest version of Python3
2). You can run this code in any IDE supporting Python3, I had personally used Jupyter Notebook HERE. 
## Documentation

This project aims to reduce mental stress and improve the mood by allowing the player to accompalish an achievable goal.
